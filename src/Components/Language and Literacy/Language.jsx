          <h1>Importance of Language in Creativity</h1>
          <p>
            Language and literacy are central to creative expression and early
            meaning-making. Children use language not only to communicate but to
            imagine, question, negotiate roles, and narrate experiences.
            Creative language practices—such as storytelling, dramatic dialogue,
            and invented spelling—foster higher-order thinking and build
            narrative competence. According to Vygotsky, language is the tool
            for thought development, and literacy practices scaffold cognitive
            growth within the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Additionally,
            Halliday’s functional approach to language emphasizes how children
            develop linguistic structures by engaging in purposeful
            communication (Kellogg & Li, 2021). Literacy-rich environments
            promote curiosity, identity formation, and collaborative creativity
            from birth.

          <h1>Theoretical Foundations</h1>
          <p>
            Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory underscores the role of language as
            both a medium and a product of learning. Through adult scaffolding
            in the ZPD, children internalize complex structures of thought and
            narrative. Language development is social before it becomes
            individual—dialogue, shared reading, and storytelling thus become
            key creative events (Seon-Mi & Kellogg, 2022). Halliday’s Functional
            Grammar sees language as a meaning-making system. He identified
            seven functions of language in early childhood: instrumental,
            regulatory, interactional, personal, heuristic, imaginative, and
            representational (Halliday, 1975). When children role-play, tell
            stories, or ask questions, they develop these functions, building
            not just vocabulary but intentional use of language. Together, these
            theories position language and literacy as interactive, purposeful,
            and deeply creative processes.
