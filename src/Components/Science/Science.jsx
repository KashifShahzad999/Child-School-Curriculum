          <h1>Importance of Science in Creativity</h1>
          <p>
            Science in early childhood education is a catalyst for creative
            inquiry. Children are natural scientists—observing, questioning, and
            experimenting to make sense of their world. Science learning
            nurtures curiosity, divergent thinking, and problem-solving skills
            when grounded in hands-on discovery. In STEAM contexts, science is
            no longer isolated but integrated with art, engineering, and
            technology to encourage <strong>creative confidence</strong> and
            cross-domain fluency (Liu et al., 2023). Through project-based
            exploration, children develop foundational scientific literacy and
            imaginative thinking, preparing them to become resilient, flexible
            learners (Ramesh, 2025).

          <h1>Theoretical Foundations</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Jerome Bruner’s Inquiry-Based Learning</strong> model
            emphasizes discovery as the core of learning. Bruner (1961) argued
            that young learners must be active participants in the construction
            of knowledge, not passive recipients. This approach is highly
            compatible with early science education, where children engage in
            hands-on experiments, ask "what if?" questions, and test hypotheses
            through observation and play. <br />{" "}
            <strong>STEAM and STEM Integration</strong> expands science beyond
            facts and procedures. It invites children to connect scientific
            knowledge with <strong>creativity, arts, and engineering</strong>{" "}
            through interdisciplinary tasks. As Parajuli (2023) notes, effective
            STEAM education fosters holistic development—combining critical
            thinking with artistic imagination and design fluency. Project-Based
            Learning (PjBL-STEM) also enhances collaborative learning and
            creativity in early settings (Retno et al., 2025).
